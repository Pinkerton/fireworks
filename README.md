Playful particle system

 * Old project to make a simple particle system in C++
 * Lots of pretty colors!
 * Utilizes the Cinder graphics framework
 * Very Java-looking C++
 * Was a part of a group of three bored students' efforts to create prettier virtual fireworks than one another (other projects are somewhere online)
